# Brick Breaker (2D)

> Brick Breaker is a clone of the classic arcade game Breakout which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. When all the bricks have been destroyed, the player advances to a new, harder level. The player gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. If all lives are lost, the game is over.

I am grateful to @zigurous for sharing this project. I added AI features to the project, which was a great way to apply what I've been learning in school as an AI & DS student. I wanted to create an agent that could control the paddle and win the game. I used the ml-agents library to train my agent. The pretrained model is included in this repository and can be found in the Models folder. I also recorded a short clip of the agent playing the game to show its performance.
